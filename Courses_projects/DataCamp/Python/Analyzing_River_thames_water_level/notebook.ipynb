In this project, you’ll work with a time series that tracks the tide levels of the Thames River. You’ll first load the data and inspect it data visually, and then perform calculations on the dataset to generate some summary statistics. You’ll end by decomposing the time series into its component attributes and analyzing them. \n","\n","The original dataset is available from the British Oceanographic Data Center [here](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/published_data_library/catalogue/10.5285/b66afb2c-cd53-7de9-e053-6c86abc0d251) and you can read all about this fascinating archival story in [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01223-7) from the Nature journal.\n","\n","Here's a map of the locations of the tidal gauges along the River Thames in London.\n","\n","![](locations.png)\n","\n","The dataset comes with a file called `Data_description.pdf`. The dataset consists of 13 `.txt` files, containing comma separated data. We'll begin by analyzing one of them, the London Bridge gauge, and preparing it for analysis. The same code can be used to analyze data from other files (i.e. other gauges along the river) later.\n","\n","\n","\n","| Variable Name | Description | Format |\n","| ------------- | ----------- | ------ |\n","| Date and time | Date and time of measurement to GMT.
