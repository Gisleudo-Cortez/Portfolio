There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":28,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1695812962052,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":194,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"building_code","type":"string"},{"name":"average_math","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_reading","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_writing","type":"integer"},{"name":"percent_tested","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":0,"school_name":"New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School","borough":"Manhattan","building_code":"M022","average_math":657,"average_reading":601,"average_writing":601,"percent_tested":null},{"index":1,"school_name":"Essex Street Academy","borough":"Manhattan","building_code":"M445","average_math":395,"average_reading":411,"average_writing":387,"percent_tested":78.9},{"index":2,"school_name":"Lower Manhattan Arts Academy","borough":"Manhattan","building_code":"M445","average_math":418,"average_reading":428,"average_writing":415,"percent_tested":65.1},{"index":3,"school_name":"High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies","borough":"Manhattan","building_code":"M445","average_math":613,"average_reading":453,"average_writing":463,"percent_tested":95.9},{"index":4,"school_name":"Henry Street School for International Studies","borough":"Manhattan","building_code":"M056","average_math":410,"average_reading":406,"average_writing":381,"percent_tested":59.7}]},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
